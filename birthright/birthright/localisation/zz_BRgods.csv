gods.2.desc;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] lies dead, struck down as though [From.GetSheHe] were no god at all, but just another mortal creature.  I have seen the body for myself, unmoving, a seeming wan and empty thing without [From.GetHerHis] force infusing it.  What am I to make of this?  What can I now believe?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gods.2.a;I have my faith, and [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] will receive my worship, however things appear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gods.2.b;If even gods may die in such a way, there is no purpose to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gods.2.c;Perhaps I should consider the teachings of my people...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gods.2.d;[From.GetHerHisCap] power came from Azrai - it is He I should have worshipped all along.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
