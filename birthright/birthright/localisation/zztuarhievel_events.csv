EVTDESC_TH_1;I am Fhileraene of the noble elven house of Llyrandor, Protector of the last elven realm in the Aelvinwode, King of Tuarhievel. As all elves I am blessed with immortality, short has been my reign and there are already troubles plaguing my realm - The constant threat from The Gorgon, the pressing concern of humans in our borders, and finally the never ending altercations between the factions which saw my mother, Queen Ibelcoris, murdered. Now after two centuries it is my duty to keep the succession safe and take a wife, but it is a great deal, choosing an elven woman such as Rhuandice Tuarlachiem would please my people and help with the unrest between factions, but I am awestruck by humans, the young half-elf Savane Mhoried has captivated my heart. Choosing to follow my heart over my people would surely anger some of the more traditional elves, and certainly sadden those closest to me, because they know what fate awaits those of human descent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TH_1;Savane Mhoried shall be my Queen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TH_1;Rhuandice Tuarlachiem shall be my Queen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TH_1;I shan't take a wife!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
