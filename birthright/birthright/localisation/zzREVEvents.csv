##Lost Possession##
EVTDESClost_possession.0;For the last couple of months the stress has been taking a toll on my health. But it doesn't end there, as of lately, I've being hearing whispers every now and then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESClost_possession.1;It hasn't been enough to be hearing whispers around every dark corner, but to top it off, I see stuff randomly moving around like it's no ones business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESClost_possession.2;Lately, those whispers have become more than just simple murmurs in the dark. I can hear something calling my name, deep beyond the void.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESClost_possession.3;You wake up this morning feeling uneasy, as if something were about to go horribly wrong. All of a sudden the candles that were previously lit go off, you stop hearing the whispers, and a figure from the void appers before you. Before you can warn your guards, you are struck with an almost un-imaginable pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESClost_possession.4;Your guard wakes you up, explaining that he found you out cold in the floor. Before you can explain your guard what happened, you decide no to tell a soul about what just transpired, considering this may alter your status with your vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESClost_possession.5;Your time in the void has ended, you have successfully managed to take control over this mortal. You must start preparing for the imminent return of your one true master the mortals so foolishly call 'The Cold Rider', for I know my master's true name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESClost_possession.6;My [Root.GetLordLady], rumours from [From.Capital.GetName] speak of a darkness looming over the towns-people. They say the current [From.GetLordLady] was deeply under stress this last few months but there has been a sudden change in [From.GetHerHis] personality and has gone even as far as to deny the clergy's request for an audience, and those who manage to get an audience get an uneasy feeling. Not only that, but reports also suggest that holdings have been erected all over the realm and the taxes have been rising. People all over the land speak of troubled times and are afraid to speak ill of their [From.GetLordLady] fearing jail time or worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
