EARLY_MED_INFO;The year is 1524 of Haelyn's Count - in Anuire the Prince of Avanil, The Archduke of Boeruine, and The Grand Baron of Ghoere are finally on the move staking their claims to the Anuirean Empire first founded by Roele Andu. The Awnsheighleen are putting in motion their long wrought plans of conquest. The Anuireans are on the verge of unification, the elves may start putting their plans on motion, The Gorgon preparing for a mass invasion of the might which Cerilia has never see before. Will you be able to unite the Anuireans, defeat The Gorgon and be crowned emperor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_3;Raesene Andu or as he is commonly known today - The Gorgon, is the greatest of the Awnsheigh on Cerilia, and the most feared. A brooding, raging presence, closer to a god than to the man he once was, he was brother to Haelyn and Roele, betrayer of the Anuirean Empire, champion of Azrai and scourge of Anuire, and slayer of the Imperial line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_313;Darien Avan, Prince of Avanil, is probably the most recognizable, respected and celebrated regent in all of Anuire, perhaps in all of Cerilia. He may not be loved, he may be distrusted, but he is almost universally respected, and he works hard to maintain and earn this respect from his peers, hoping to one day parley it into reunifying the Anuirean Empire under his banner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_10211;Gerad ibn Farid el-Arrasi, Prince of Ariya rules the city of the same name, as well as the Ariyan Temple of Avani. Like all in his line, he claims descent from the Great King el-Arrasi, and is the eighty-forth Khinasi ruler of Ariya. The prince, a dignified warrior in his early forties, has a sharp mind and can truly see into a person's heart. He believes Ariya should act as the political and moral leader of all Khinasi and insists on formality in all dealings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_20128;Barak Wohlken is the Tsarevo of Yeninskiy. Barak once led Vos armies in their defence against the Iron Hand Tribes. Now, he concentrates on protecting Yeninskiy's western provinces from the predations of the Raven. Oft-styled as brutal and savage even for a Vos war chief, Barak does what he must to keep the Raven's armies out of Yeninskiy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_25007;The ruler of the last elf domain in the Aelvinwode is Fhileraene of House Llyrandor, King of Tuarhievel. Fhileraene seems an enigma to all around him, while he entertains traders from human lands he also holds court with the most hate-filled of the elves. He loves life, a quality one normally associates with elves, but he also flies into moods of black rage. Though smooth and handsome his demeanour hides lines of ugliness and hatred just below the surface.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_44354;Erik is the unyielding ruler of the oldest line of nobility in Brechtur. Coming from an unbroken line of Danigs that can be traced past the battle of Mount Deismaar to the first wave of settlers in the Great Bay region. Even the royal house of Muden cannot boast so clear and unbroken a lineage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCADVENTUREMENU.0;Though you are a ruler, you can still go adventuring in search of fame, glory, and experience. You can leave the affairs of state to a regent who will act in your stead while you are away.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTUREMENU.1;If your children have an adventuring class and are unlanded, you can give them an honorary title 'adventurer' and they will go. If you take it away, they will return.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTUREMENU.2;Your parents have encouraged you to go adventuring and find fame and fortune. As you are unlanded, you have little choice in the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTUREMENU.3;Your parents have told you to come home and stop your adventuring career. As you are unlanded, you have little choice in the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.0;You are informed that a necromancer lives deep beneath your city's sewers, and is raising an army of undead from amongst the plague victims. The citizens are in a panic and this threat must be dealt with.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.1;A message arrives from a ruler, asking if you would help his land defeat a necromancer re-animating plague victims and building an army. He will pay 10 gold. What do you say?.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.2;The necromancer has raised hundreds of undead now, and you have no choice but to act now. Will you send in the city guard, or call for an adventurer to deal with it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.3;The adventuring party arrives and is quickly briefed on the situation. For 10 gold, they will go into the sewers and attempt to defeat this necromancer before he can summon an army of undead against you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.4;You reach your destination. Fighting through dozens of undead beneath the city sewers, you finally come to the necromancer's lair - it is well guarded, and your small party is already tired. Yet you cannot rest, you must press on!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.5;You bravely charge ahead, and just as it seems you are about to be overwhelmed by hordes of undead, you strike down the necromancer and his minions fall lifeless to the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.6;You bravely charge ahead, but you are overwhelmed by undead - you cannot get close enough to slay the necromancer, and you find yourself surrounded and overwhelmed! The last thing you remember are sharp claws dragging you down.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.7;The adventuring party arrives back safely, having defeated the necromancer. Your city is safe, and they are hailed as heroes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.8;By some miracle, your companions manage to save you and drag you out of the sewers. You are grievously wounded, however, and your quest has failed...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.9;You return triumphant, and a great feast is held in your honor. You are duly paid, and the next morning, you set off for new adventures.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.10;You return triumphant, only to find the gates of the castle barred to you. 'Begone ruffians, the ruler shouts from the walls - or I'll have you arrested for vagrancy!' ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.11;The adventurers have failed, and are either dead, wounded, or captured now. What should be done? ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.13;While visiting a tavern, you hear stories of a nearby cave rumored to be a gnoll lair. Do you want to investigate?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.14;After a week of searching, you finally come upon some gnoll tracks which lead to a dark cave. Preparing yourself as best as you are able, you light some torches and prepare to destroy this threat to the local community.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.15;You march into the gnoll lair, and though they are strong opponents, they are no match for your party's superior skill and tactics. After slaying half a dozen of them, you find some treasure and quickly claim it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.16;You march into the gnoll lair, and quickly find yourself in trouble. Six gnolls come at you all at once, and you are hard pressed to make it back to the exit alive!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.17;While visiting a tavern, you hear stories of a witch, possibly a priestess of Kriesha, stealing children from the village. She lives in a cave a few days away. Do you want to investigate?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.18;After some searching, you finally come upon a cave with skulls decorating the entrance and the symbol of Kriesha carved with blood into the rocks. Do you enter?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.19;You march into the cave, and as soon as you do, are met by a hail of ice sprouting from the fingertips of a darkly beautiful woman dressed in white robes. After a quick but fierce battle, you kill her, and free the children.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.20;As soon as you march into the cave, you are surprised by a cone of icy cold sprouting from the fingers of a beautiful woman dressed in white, quickly followed by four of her apprentices whose chants almost bring you to your knees with pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.21;As your party travels through the wilds, you are suddenly ambused by a band of outlaws.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.22;You take cover from the initial ambush, and after a brief moment, take the fight to them. You slay several, and the rest flee in terror before your party's overpowering strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.23;The ambush was well set-up! Two dozen archers pin you down, and they have mounted troops and what seems to be a half-giant! If you rush them, there's a good chance you won't make it...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.24;Ignoring a hail of arrows, you order your party to attack! With steel, stealth, sorcery and priestly powers, you throw everything you have at them, and...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.25;The fight is brutal, but the ferocity and strength of your charge throws off the brigands. The archers flee as you near them, and a fierce fight follows where you personally slay their leader. The rest turn and run!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.26;You rush the brigands, but you take an arrow to the knee as you leave cover! Another arrow hits one of your companions through the throat. This is not going well. A man approaches with a mace, seeking to knock you out!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.27;While resting around the camp fire one night, your party is suddenly ambused by a band of goblins.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.28;Like the well trained professionals that you are, you quickly jump to arms and engage the goblins! There are almost two dozen of them, but their ambush was clumsy and loud - you swiftly defeat them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.29;You seem to be under attack from an entire goblin tribe, and they have gnolls with them! Disorganized, you cannot mount a proper defense. It would be wise to let them have you gear and make a run for it...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.30;Gathering your party together, fighting back to back, you face the rush of dozens of goblins and gnolls!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.31;Your party stands firm against the onslaught, fighting as a well disciplined team against the disorganized goblins. They cannot break your line, and soon a goblin horn sounds the retreat. Cowardly creatures!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.32;The goblins encircle you, and the larger gnolls rush at you. Take them alive, yells the goblin chief, and your line begins to break under the pressure. Gnoll hands grasp at you, pulling you away from your party...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.33;While your army is fully capable of fighting the battles to come, sometimes it helps to have an extra edge. Shall you hire a band of adventurers to help you win this war? They would cost 50 gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.34;A message arrives from a ruler, asking if you would help fight a war against their enemies. You would primarily be used for special missions. It would pay 50 gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.35;The adventuring party arrives and is quickly briefed on the situation. You pay them their fee, and sit together in council deciding how best to use them in the war...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.36;You arrive at the court of the ruler who has hired you, and sit together discussing how best to use you in the battles ahead. The ruler wants you to instigate rebellions amongst his enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.37;You arrive at the court of the ruler who has hired you, and sit together discussing how best to use you in the battles ahead. The ruler wants you assassinate enemy nobles and commanders...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.38;You arrive at the court of the ruler who has hired you, and sit together discussing how best to use you in the battles ahead. The ruler wants you to steal from the enemy, making him unable to pay for his troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.39;You arrive at the court of the ruler who has hired you, and sit together discussing how best to use you in the battles ahead. The ruler wants you to lead a unit of adventurers during the battles.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.40;You travel behind enemy lines, and begin to work on instigating a rebellion. What will you focus your message on?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTAADVENTURER.40;The unfairness of hereditary monarchy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTBADVENTURER.40;Taxes are too high!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTCADVENTURER.40;The ruler is in league with demons!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.41;You travel behind enemy lines, and begin to plot your assassinations of enemy notables. Who will you strike at?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTAADVENTURER.41;The enemy Marshall.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTBADVENTURER.41;A random enemy count.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTCADVENTURER.41;I'll just go on a general killing spree!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.43;As ordered, you begin assembling a band of adventurers into a proper fighting force of some fifty people with various skills and talents to use on the battlefield at critical moments. How will you lead them?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTAADVENTURER.43;I will lead from the front.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTBADVENTURER.43;I will lead from the center.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTCADVENTURER.43;I will lead from the rear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.44;The insolence! The ragged adventurers claim to be too good for your task, and outright refuses! They return the gold, and says the job was not what they expected they would be doing. Why I'll...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.45;The ruler is enraged at your refusal, and screams for his guards to arrest you immediately! What do you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.46;In an instant, you react, striking out at the ruler with all your power. He is caught off-guard, and falls quickly to the groundm dead or severely wounded! You then turn to rush the guards, heading for the nearest exit!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.47;In an instant, you react, striking out at the ruler with all your power. The guards jump in front of him however, and you soon find yourself surrounded, and more reinforcements on the way. There is no way out of this...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.48;As soon as you call for their arrest, the adventurers spring into action, launching a furious assault upon your person! Before you can react, you are struck down, and blackness falls upon you...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.49;As soon as you call for their arrest, the adventurers spring into action, launching a furious assault upon your person! You and your guards react swiftly though, and soon have them surrounded - they surrender...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.50;You are taken to the darkest dungeon, and unceremoniously dumped on the ground there, stripped of all your belongings. You'll have to hope you can pay the ransom, before they decide to execute you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.51;During the last few weeks, you have been railing against the unfairness of hereditary rulers. The peasants are listening, and you have convinced them that together, they are powerful and wise enough to rule themselves!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.52;During the last few weeks, you have been railing against the unfairness of high taxes. The peasants are listening, and you have convinced them that they should stop paying them immediately until they are lowered.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.53;During the last few weeks, you have been fabricating evidence that their ruler is in league with demonic forces. They are frightened, and up in arms, vowing to burn this evil out of his castle.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.54;It seems one of your enemies has hired a band of adventurers to instigate a peasant revolt in your demesne... let's hope they have more sense than to listen to such nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.55;During the last few weeks, you have been seeking ways to kill the enemy Marshall. Finally, an opportunity presents itself during a moonless night...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.56;During the last few weeks, you have been seeking ways to kill an enemy count. Finally, an opportunity presents itself during a moonless night...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.57;During the last few weeks, you have been seeking ways to kill a large bunch of enemy notables. An opportunity presents itself, when you find a group of young enemy nobles drinking at a tavern, on the way to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.58;During the night, you hear a thud outside your door. Like a body falling... the door creeps open, and an assassin sneaks in. Treachery!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.59;You quietly dispatch the guard in front of the Marshall's door, and catch him unaware in bed! You rush towards him, and deliver a mortal blow before he can react, and then escape out the window.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.60;As you sneak into the Marshall's quarters after dispatching the guard, he hears you, and rushes out of bed screaming for the guards! He sleeps in his armour, and comes at you wielding a longsword!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.61;You heard the assassin coming, and seeing that you are awake and prepared to fight, the shadowy figure quickly disappears into the night!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.62;You heard the assassin coming, and after a quick struggle where neither of you can gain the advantage, the assassin thinks better of it, and runs away!!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.63;The assassin enters your quarters, and comes right at you! You only see a shadowy figure clothed in black, before you feel a sharp pain and then... blackness!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.64;You enter the target's quarters and decide to fight, despite being discovered. A swift and furious struggle ensues, but finally the Marshall is dealt a deadly blow just as you hear the guards come running down the corridor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.65;You enter the target's quarters and decide to fight, despite being discovered. A swift and furious struggle ensues, you cannot quickly dispatch him! Guards are coming now, the castle bells are ringing...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.66;During the night, you hear a noise outside your door. Like a body falling... the door creaps open, and an assassin sneaks in. Treachery!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.67;You quietly dispatch the guard in front of the count's door, and catch him at unawares in bed! You rush towards him, and deliver a mortal blow before he can react, and then escape out the window.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.68;As you sneak into the count's quarters after dispatching the guard, he hears you, and rushes out of bed screaming for the guards! He sleeps in his armor, and comes at you wielding a longsword!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.69;After a night of drinking, you sleep in a tavern with other young nobles, on the way to the front lines of the war. A door creaks open and...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.70;You are drinking at a tavern, and some strangers approach and engage you in talk. Suddenly you feel lightheaded, and notice a white substance in your wine... you feel faint, ill, and your heart is racing!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.71;Suddenly you are drinking in a tavern with some friends, and a wizard starts chanting. You have only a moment to turn your head, and then a massive fireball approaches!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.72;After the group retires to the night, you and your party sneak into their quarters, aiming to kill them in their sleep. This one dies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.73;You engage the group of young nobles, drinking and swapping tales, and all the while adding a deadly poison to your drinks whenever you can. It is slow acting, and the next morning, this one has died!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.74;You are not the subtle type. Seeing a group of enemy nobles, you or your party wizard starts casting a fireball spell directly towards them. Panic erupts in the tavern and the flames are spreadign. This one has died!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.75;Six months have passed, and your mercenary contract period is over. You can now return to normal adventuring, or take another contract with a different ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.76;The campaign reaches a critical point, and your group of adventurers is needed at a key moment. Leading from the front, you rush in to plug a hole in the battle line that you can see is developing!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.77;The campaign reaches a critical point, and your group of adventurers is needed at a key moment. With your men forming a perimeter around you, you rush in to plug a hole in the battle line that you can see is developing!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.78;The campaign reaches a critical point, and your group of adventurers is needed at a key moment. Gathering your men, you order them to rush ahead to plug a hole in the battle line that you can see is developing!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.79;While visiting a tavern, the townspeople beg you to help them dispatch a small tribe of giants that has been stealing their cattle. This is a dangerous quest, but you will never achieve mastery without taking risks...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.80;After a week of searching, you finally come upon the giant tribe. There are a dozen of them, and they don't seem to have spotted you yet...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.81;You prepare as best you can, and then engage this most dangerous enemy. The giants quickly spring into action, but your long adventuring career has prepared you for such dangers - you finally slay the last of them!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.82;You engage the giants, but one of them is a priest of terrible power - Lightning cracks from the sky, and elementals are summoned to their aid - you have no chance of victory here!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURING.0;You decide to take up adventuring, being the child of a powerful ruler but not directly in the line of succession. Perhaps you can win fame and fortune with your own skills, that will one day grant you a realm of your own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURING.1;You're getting older now, and it is finally time to settle down, many say. It's time to come home with your fame and loot, and look to a future away from dusty roads and dark dungeons!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURING.2;You have sustained a grievous injury, and until you can find a priest to heal you, there is no way you can keep up the demands of the adventuring life. For now, you will have to retire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURING.3;Your child has decided to take up the life of an adventurer, and will travel the land in search of fame and fortune. Do you give your blessing to this endeavor?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURING.4;Your parents disapprove, and demand that you do not leave for the adventuring life. What do you say?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURING.5;Your child rejects your demand to stay, and short of locking him up, there is little you can do...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURING.6;Your child accepts your demand to stay at court, but is not happy about it...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURING.7;Your child returns one night, gravely wounded, carried home by his companions. He is maimed, and unless a priest can regenerate his body, the adventuring days are long gone...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURING.8;You have now become a trained professional in your adventuring class. To achieve mastery, however, you will either need to continue adventuring, or train with a current master which can become very costly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURING.9;You have now become a recognized master in your adventuring class. To become a legend, however, you will have to undertake a legendary quest - and survive it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURING.10;This character has become a master of their craft, whether of war, magic, song or stealth, and word of their name is quickly spreading. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURING.11;As a master of your craft, perhaps it is time to retire. Unless you risk life and limb on an epic quest, you will not advance further, and it might seem like a good idea to settle down now and enjoy your wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURING.12;You have now become a legend in your own time. Your skills rank you as amongst the most deadly and competent individuals in the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURING.13;This character has become a legend, having completed a quest which all the land is talking about. Their skills rank them as amongst the most powerful individuals in Cerilia now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURING.14;As a legend, perhaps it is time to retire from the active life and make way for a new generation of heroes. Perhaps it is time to settle down and spend some of your wealth?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCANUIREINTRO.0;Avanil is one of the most powerful realms in Anuire. It is a rich land of fertile farms and walled cities, and many feel certain that their Prince will be the new Emperor. Only Boeruine stands in the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCANUIREINTRO.1;Boeruine is a powerful realm, matched only by Avanil. Cities dot the entire coastline, and the forests are rich. Its people feel proud that their Archduke is certain to press his rightful claim soon and become Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCANUIREINTRO.2;Talinie is a wild and forested realm, constantly on guard against the goblins of Thurazor. It has recently decided to accept Boeruine's claim on the Iron Throne, hoping a united Anuire will lead to the end of goblin and elf raids. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCANUIREINTRO.3;Brosengae is a heavily populated realm, though it suffers from harsh storms at times from the sea. It is supporting Avanil's claim to the Iron Throne, and is frequently the site of battles between them and Boeruine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCANUIREINTRO.4;Taeghas is a fair land with an independent-minded people, but it's ruler has been unconcerned with statecraft for a long time. Darien Avan of Avanil rules this land, in all but name.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCANUIREINTRO.5;The Free City of Endier is one of the greatest in Anuire. Under the rulership of the half-elf Guilder Kalien, it is a rich - yet also dangerous - place of commerce, intrigue, and decadence. Guarding its independence fiercely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCANUIREINTRO.6;Diemed is a rich land on the southern coast, but has recently lost it's eastern parts to Medoere, Ilien, and Roesone. In the old days of the empire, that whole region was known as the Archduchy of Diemed - and be so again...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCANUIREINTRO.7;Medoere is a small Theocracy of followers of the Celestial Temple of Ruornil, the god of magic. The land is fertile, but always the shadow of the Spiderfell falls upon its northern borders. Raids by fierce spider-riding goblins are common here. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCANUIREINTRO.8;Ilien is one of the largest cities in Anuire, its walls standing 50 feet high. It is a rich and powerful city, and the main port of call for Khinasi traders in Anuire. Rumours say everything can be found here - for a price that is.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCANUIREINTRO.9;Roesone was carved out of the Archduchy of Diemed by a fierce warrior named Daen commonly known as 'The Black Baron'. His great grand-daughter Marlae now rules this fair land of deep forests, rolling hills, and fiercely independent people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCANUIREINTRO.10;The Erebannien, last of the pristine forests of southern Anuire, covers much of this beautiful land. It is famous for its fine wines and unspoilt wilderness. It is not uncommon to see Fey folk dancing on the hills during moonlit nights.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCANUIREINTRO.11;Ghoere is a rich land in central Anuire, and its Grand Baron is considered a contender for the Imperial Throne. The geography makes it difficult however - surrounded by unfriendly states, one wrong move can be fatal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAWNSHEIGHLEEN.1;You have changed your religion to one of the Gods of Good, and your realm is in chaos. Vassals who previously served you out of fear or desire for loot now openly question your sanity. This is not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBLOODFIX.0;Something went wrong, and you are blooded with no bloodscore. You now get a bloodscore of 10.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBLOODLINE.2;You have increased your bloodline powers using the regency you have absorbed over the years. You now have a minor bloodline.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

adventurer36desc;You arrive at the court of the ruler who has hired you, and sit together discussing how best to use you in the battles ahead. The ruler wants you to instigate rebellions amongst his enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.0;You are informed that a necromancer lives deep beneath your city's sewers, and is raising an army of undead from amongst the plague victims. The citizens are in a panic and this threat must be dealt with.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.1;A message arrives from a ruler, asking if you would help his land defeat a necromancer re-animating plague victims and building an army. He will pay 10 gold. What do you say?.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.2;The necromancer has raised hundreds of undead now, and you have no choice but to act now. Will you send in the city guard, or call for an adventurer to deal with it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.3;The adventuring party arrives and is quickly briefed on the situation. For 10 gold, they will go into the sewers and attempt to defeat this necromancer before he can summon an army of undead against you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.4;You reach your destination. Fighting through dozens of undead beneath the city sewers, you finally come to the necromancer's lair - it is well guarded, and your small party is already tired. Yet you cannot rest, you must press on!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.5;You bravely charge ahead, and just as it seems you are about to be overwhelmed by hordes of undead, you strike down the necromancer and his minions fall lifeless to the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.6;You bravely charge ahead, but you are overwhelmed by undead - you cannot get close enough to slay the necromancer, and you find yourself surrounded and overwhelmed! The last thing you remember are sharp claws dragging you down.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.7;The adventuring party arrives back safely, having defeated the necromancer. Your city is safe, and they are hailed as heroes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.8;By some miracle, your companions manage to save you and drag you out of the sewers. You are grievously wounded, however, and your quest has failed...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.9;You return triumphant, and a great feast is held in your honor. You are duly paid, and the next morning, you set off for new adventures.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.10;You return triumphant, only to find the gates of the castle barred to you. 'Begone ruffians, the ruler shouts from the walls - or I'll have you arrested for vagrancy!' ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.11;The adventurers have failed, and are either dead, wounded, or captured now. What should be done? ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.13;While visiting a tavern, you hear stories of a nearby cave rumored to be a troll's lair. Do you want to investigate?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.14;After a week of searching, you finally come upon some troll tracks which lead to a dark cave. Preparing yourself as best as you are able, you light some torches and prepare to destroy this threat to the local community.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.15;You march into troll the lair, and though they are strong opponents, they are no match for your party's superior skill and tactics. After slaying half a dozen of them, you find some treasure and quickly claim it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.16;You march into troll the lair, and quickly find yourself in trouble. Six trolls come at you all at once, and you are hard pressed to make it back to the exit alive!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.17;While visiting a tavern, you hear stories of a witch, possibly a priestess of Kriesha, stealing children from the village. She lives in a cave a few days away. Do you want to investigate?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.18;After some searching, you finally come upon a cave with skulls decorating the entrance and the symbol of Kriesha carved with blood into the rocks. Do you enter?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.19;You march into the cave, and as soon as you do, are met by a hail of ice sprouting from the fingertips of a darkly beautiful woman dressed in white robes. After a quick but fierce battle, you kill her, and free the children.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.20;As soon as you march into the cave, you are surprised by a cone of icy cold sprouting from the fingers of a beautiful woman dressed in white, quickly followed by four of her apprentices whose chants almost bring you to your knees with pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.21;As your party travels through the wilds, you are suddenly ambused by a band of outlaws.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.22;You take cover from the initial ambush, and after a brief moment, take the fight to them. You slay several, and the rest flee in terror before your party's overpowering strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.23;The ambush was well set-up! Two dozen archers pin you down, and they have mounted troops and what seems to be a half-giant! If you rush them, there's a good chance you won't make it...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.24;Ignoring a hail of arrows, you order your party to attack! With steel, stealth, sorcery and priestly powers, you throw everything you have at them, and...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.25;The fight is brutal, but the ferocity and strength of your charge throws off the brigands. The archers flee as you near them, and a fierce fight follows where you personally slay their leader. The rest turn and run!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.26;You rush the brigands, but you take an arrow to the knee as you leave cover! Another arrow hits one of your companions through the throat. This is not going well. A man approaches with a mace, seeking to knock you out!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.27;While resting around the camp fire one night, your party is suddenly ambused by a band of goblins.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.28;Like the well trained professionals that you are, you quickly jump to arms and engage the goblins! There are almost two dozen of them, but their ambush was clumsy and loud - you swiftly defeat them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.29;You seem to be under attack from an entire goblin tribe, and they have gnolls with them! Disorganized, you cannot mount a proper defense. It would be wise to let them have you gear and make a run for it...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.30;Gathering your party together, fighting back to back, you face the rush of dozens of goblins and gnolls!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.31;Your party stands firm against the onslaught, fighting as a well disciplined team against the disorganized goblins. They cannot break your line, and soon a goblin horn sounds the retreat. Cowardly creatures!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.32;The goblins encircle you, and the larger gnolls rush at you. Take them alive, yells the goblin chief, and your line begins to break under the pressure. Gnoll hands grasp at you, pulling you away from your party...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.33;While your army is fully capable of fighting the battles to come, sometimes it helps to have an extra edge. Shall you hire a band of adventurers to help you win this war? They would cost 50 gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.34;A message arrives from a ruler, asking if you would help fight a war against their enemies. You would primarily be used for special missions. It would pay 50 gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.35;The adventuring party arrives and is quickly briefed on the situation. You pay them their fee, and sit together in council deciding how best to use them in the war...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.36;You arrive at the court of the ruler who has hired you, and sit together discussing how best to use you in the battles ahead. The ruler wants you to instigate rebellions amongst his enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.36.a;Great! Peasants love rebelling.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.36.b;I'll do it, but I don't like using peasants this way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.36.c;I won't do it. The peasants will all die.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.37;You arrive at the court of the ruler who has hired you, and sit together discussing how best to use you in the battles ahead. The ruler wants you assassinate enemy nobles and commanders...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.37.a;Great! I love killing...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.37.b;I'll do it, but I don't like it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.37.c;I won't do it. I'm no assassin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.38;You arrive at the court of the ruler who has hired you, and sit together discussing how best to use you in the battles ahead. The ruler wants you to steal from the enemy, making him unable to pay for his troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.38.a;Great! I love stealing...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.38.b;I'll do it, but I don't like stealing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.38.c;I won't do it. I'm no thief.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.39;You arrive at the court of the ruler who has hired you, and sit together discussing how best to use you in the battles ahead. The ruler wants you to lead a unit of adventurers during the battles.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.40;You travel behind enemy lines, and begin to work on instigating a rebellion. What will you focus your message on?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTAADVENTURER.40;The unfairness of hereditary monarchy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTBADVENTURER.40;Taxes are too high!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTCADVENTURER.40;The ruler is in league with demons!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.41;You travel behind enemy lines, and begin to plot your assassinations of enemy notables. Who will you strike at?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTAADVENTURER.41;The enemy Marshall.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTBADVENTURER.41;A random enemy count.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTCADVENTURER.41;I'll just go on a general killing spree!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.43;As ordered, you begin assembling a band of adventurers into a proper fighting force of some fifty people with various skills and talents to use on the battlefield at critical moments. How will you lead them?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTAADVENTURER.43;I will lead from the front.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTBADVENTURER.43;I will lead from the center.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTCADVENTURER.43;I will lead from the rear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.44;The insolence! The ragged adventurers claim to be too good for your task, and outright refuses! They return the gold, and says the job was not what they expected they would be doing. Why I'll...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTAADVENTURER.44;Probably be better off without them anyways...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTBADVENTURER.44;Let them go, but never forget this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTCADVENTURER.44;Guards, arrest them!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.45;The ruler is enraged at your refusal, and screams for his guards to arrest you immediately! What do you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAADVENTURER.45;Kill the faithless fool, then run!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCADVENTURER.45;Allow the guards to arrest you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.46;In an instant, you react, striking out at the ruler with all your power. He is caught off-guard, and falls quickly to the ground dead or severely wounded! You then turn to rush the guards, heading for the nearest exit!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAADVENTURER.46;Hah! That'll show him!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.47;In an instant, you react, striking out at the ruler with all your power. The guards jump in front of him however, and you soon find yourself surrounded, and more reinforcements on the way. There is no way out of this...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.48;As soon as you call for their arrest, the adventurers spring into action, launching a furious assault upon your person! Before you can react, you are struck down, and blackness falls upon you...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAADVENTURER.48;*you fall to the ground*;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.49;As soon as you call for their arrest, the adventurers spring into action, launching a furious assault upon your person! You and your guards react swiftly though, and soon have them surrounded - they surrender...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAADVENTURER.49;They'll pay for this...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.50;You are taken to the darkest dungeon, and unceremoniously dumped on the ground there, stripped of all your belongings. You'll have to hope you can pay the ransom, before they decide to execute you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.51;During the last few weeks, you have been railing against the unfairness of hereditary rulers. The peasants are listening, and you have convinced them that together, they are powerful and wise enough to rule themselves!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAADVENTURER.51;Gullible fools...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBADVENTURER.51;Solidarity, brothers!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCADVENTURER.51;Liberty! Equality! Brotherhood!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDADVENTURER.51;I'd best leave before the dying starts...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.52;During the last few weeks, you have been railing against the unfairness of high taxes. The peasants are listening, and you have convinced them that they should stop paying them immediately until they are lowered.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAADVENTURER.52;Hah, my peasants actually pay more...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBADVENTURER.52;No more gold for tyrants!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCADVENTURER.52;Read my lips - no new taxes!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.53;During the last few weeks, you have been fabricating evidence that their ruler is in league with demonic forces. They are frightened, and up in arms, vowing to burn this evil out of his castle.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAADVENTURER.53;Hah - The only demonic force here is me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBADVENTURER.53;Kill the demons, kill them with fire!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCADVENTURER.53;Your faith will protect you - to arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.54;It seems one of your enemies has hired a band of adventurers to instigate a peasant revolt in your demesne... let's hope they have more sense than to listen to such nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAADVENTURER.54;Cursed adventurers...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.55;During the last few weeks, you have been seeking ways to kill the enemy Marshall. Finally, an opportunity presents itself during a moonless night...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAADVENTURER.55;Quietly... stealthily...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.56;During the last few weeks, you have been seeking ways to kill an enemy count. Finally, an opportunity presents itself during a moonless night...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.57;During the last few weeks, you have been seeking ways to kill a large bunch of enemy notables. An opportunity presents itself, when you find a group of young enemy nobles drinking at a tavern, on the way to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAADVENTURER.57;I'll kill them in their sleep!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBADVENTURER.57;I'll poison their wine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCADVENTURER.57;A well placed fireball spell, perhaps...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.58;During the night, you hear a thud outside your door. Like a body falling... the door creeps open, and an assassin sneaks in. Treachery!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAADVENTURER.58;Guards! *prepare to defend yourself*;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.59;You quietly dispatch the guard in front of the Marshall's door, and catch him unaware in bed! You rush towards him, and deliver a mortal blow before he can react, and then escape out the window.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAADVENTURER.59;Hah! Too easy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBADVENTURER.59;Better him dead, if it helps end the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.60;As you sneak into the Marshall's quarters after dispatching the guard, he hears you, and rushes out of bed screaming for the guards! He sleeps in his armour, and comes at you wielding a longsword!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAADVENTURER.60;Damnations! Time to run!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBADVENTURER.60;Damnations! But there's still time!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.61;You heard the assassin coming, and seeing that you are awake and prepared to fight, the shadowy figure quickly disappears into the night!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAADVENTURER.61;That was a close call!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.62;You heard the assassin coming, and after a quick struggle where neither of you can gain the advantage, the assassin thinks better of it, and runs away!!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.63;The assassin enters your quarters, and comes right at you! You only see a shadowy figure clothed in black, before you feel a sharp pain and then... blackness!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAADVENTURER.63;Nooo!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.64;You enter the target's quarters and decide to fight, despite being discovered. A swift and furious struggle ensues, but finally the Marshall is dealt a deadly blow just as you hear the guards come running down the corridor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.65;You enter the target's quarters and decide to fight, despite being discovered. A swift and furious struggle ensues, you cannot quickly dispatch him! Guards are coming now, the castle bells are ringing...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.66;During the night, you hear a noise outside your door. Like a body falling... the door creaps open, and an assassin sneaks in. Treachery!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.67;You quietly dispatch the guard in front of the count's door, and catch him at unawares in bed! You rush towards him, and deliver a mortal blow before he can react, and then escape out the window.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.68;As you sneak into the count's quarters after dispatching the guard, he hears you, and rushes out of bed screaming for the guards! He sleeps in his armor, and comes at you wielding a longsword!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.69;After a night of drinking, you sleep in a tavern with other young nobles, on the way to the front lines of the war. A door creaks open and...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAADVENTURER.69;Assassins! I hope I survive!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.70;You are drinking at a tavern, and some strangers approach and engage you in talk. Suddenly you feel lightheaded, and notice a white substance in your wine... you feel faint, ill, and your heart is racing!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAADVENTURER.70;Poison! I hope I survive!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.71;Suddenly you are drinking in a tavern with some friends, and a wizard starts chanting. You have only a moment to turn your head, and then a massive fireball approaches!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.72;After the group retires to the night, you and your party sneak into their quarters, aiming to kill them in their sleep. This one dies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAADVENTURER.72;Time to leave!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.73;You engage the group of young nobles, drinking and swapping tales, and all the while adding a deadly poison to your drinks whenever you can. It is slow acting, and the next morning, this one has died!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.74;You are not the subtle type. Seeing a group of enemy nobles, you or your party wizard starts casting a fireball spell directly towards them. Panic erupts in the tavern and the flames are spreadign. This one has died!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.75;Six months have passed, and your mercenary contract period is over. You can now return to normal adventuring, or take another contract with a different ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.76;The campaign reaches a critical point, and your group of adventurers is needed at a key moment. Leading from the front, you rush in to plug a hole in the battle line that you can see is developing!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAADVENTURER.76;Forward!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.77;The campaign reaches a critical point, and your group of adventurers is needed at a key moment. With your men forming a perimeter around you, you rush in to plug a hole in the battle line that you can see is developing!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.78;The campaign reaches a critical point, and your group of adventurers is needed at a key moment. Gathering your men, you order them to rush ahead to plug a hole in the battle line that you can see is developing!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAADVENTURER.78;Attack, men! I'll stay here.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.79;While visiting a tavern, the townspeople beg you to help them dispatch a small tribe of giants that has been stealing their cattle. This is a dangerous quest, but you will never achieve mastery without taking risks...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAADVENTURER.79;We can take em down...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBADVENTURER.79;No, giants are too much for us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.80;After a week of searching, you finally come upon the giant tribe. There are a dozen of them, and they don't seem to have spotted you yet...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBADVENTURER.80;No, wait, let's not do this...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.81;You prepare as best you can, and then engage this most dangerous enemy. The giants quickly spring into action, but your long adventuring career has prepared you for such dangers - you finally slay the last of them!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.82;You engage the giants, but one of them is a priest of terrible power - Lightning cracks from the sky, and elementals are summoned to their aid - you have no chance of victory here!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.100;All my practice is paying off!  I feel much more confident in my abilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.100b;Woot!  That last kill gave you just enough XP to go up a level!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCADVENTURER.100.b;Ding!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
